# split_the_bill
This web application is built using Flask and Python as well as some basic HTML to make a form where the user can input their information about a bill and then get the amount they have to pay back. 
The application was made because it was irritating to figure out the amount of money to pay after someone else paid the bill in a foreign country and this is my solution to make it a bit easier hopefully. Even though it is completely possible to calculate it on the calculator app, I always forget the formula so here we are.
